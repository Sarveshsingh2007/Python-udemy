<h1 class="text-warning mb-4">About This Project</h1>

<p>
  Welcome to the <strong>Harry Potter Explorer</strong> — a magical web app where you can discover and learn about your favorite characters from the wizarding world. ✨
</p>

<p>
  This project was built using <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Flask</strong>, and it fetches live data from the 
  <a href="https://hp-api.onrender.com/" class="text-warning" target="_blank">Harry Potter API</a>.
  It allows users to search for characters, view their details, and filter them by Hogwarts houses — all in a clean and responsive design.
</p>

<p>
  Creating this project helped me strengthen my understanding of APIs, Flask routing, and front-end design using <strong>Bootstrap 5</strong>.
  It’s been a fun mix of coding and creativity! 🪄
</p>

<p>
  Built with ❤️ and a touch of magic by <strong>Sarvesh</strong>.
